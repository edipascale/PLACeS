Peer-to-peer Locality-Aware Content dElivery Simulator

PLACeS is used to compare various content delivery strategies for
Video on Demand and time-shifted IPTV over a LRPON-based network.
It was written for academic purposes and it's most likely
unfit for usage in any production environment. 

The project requires Boost libraries version 1.54.0.
The latest updates also require the ILOCPLEX libraries from IBM's CPLEX.
PLACeS was tested only on Ubuntu and Debian, both 32 and 64 bit.

The source is currently being released mainly as a proof of concept;
minimal documentation is provided in the form of comments throughout 
the code. Proper documentation will be created in the future (hopefully)
to facilitate usage and/or development from third parties.

For instructions on which simulation parameters are available and how
to configure them, run the program with the --help command line argument.
