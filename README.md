Peer-to-peer Locality-Aware Content dElivery Simulator

PLACeS is used to compare various content delivery strategies for
Video on Demand and time-shifted IPTV over a PON-based network.
It was written for academic purposes and it's most likely
unfit for usage in any production environment. 

The project requires Boost libraries version 1.54.0.
It was tested only Ubuntu and Debian, both 32 and 64 bit.

The source is currently being released mainly as a proof of concept;
minimal documentation is provided in the form of comments throughout 
the code. Proper documentation will be created in the future (hopefully)
to facilitate usage and/or developement from third parties.

For instruction on which simulation parameters are available and how
to configure them, run the program with the --help command line argument.
